Gyroscope04 - AI Legal Engine for Flight Compensation
Instant flight compensation analysis powered by artificial intelligence
Gyroscope04 is an AI engine that reads flight compensation laws (EU261, DOT, APPR, Montreal Convention) and instantly determines if passengers deserve compensation. What traditionally takes 8+ months of legal processing now happens in 30 seconds.
Project Overview
What It Does

Analyzes flight disruptions against 4 major compensation regulations
Determines eligibility for passenger compensation instantly
Calculates compensation amounts (€250-€600, $400-$1400, CAD $125-$1000)
Provides confidence scores for business decision-making
Identifies edge cases requiring human review

Legal Coverage

EU261 - European Union flight compensation regulation
US DOT - Department of Transportation passenger rights
Canadian APPR - Air Passenger Protection Regulations
Montreal Convention - International baggage and injury claims

Quick Start
For Business Integration
pythonfrom gyroscope04 import Gyroscope04API

# Initialize the AI engine
gyro = Gyroscope04API("gyroaitech/gyroscope04-v1")

# Analyze a flight disruption
flight_data = {
    "airline": "Lufthansa",
    "flight_number": "LH441", 
    "departure": "Frankfurt",
    "arrival": "New York",
    "delay_hours": 4,
    "reason": "technical problem",
    "date": "2024-03-15"
}

result = gyro.analyze_flight_disruption(flight_data)
# Returns: eligible, amount, currency, confidence, regulation
Example Output
json{
    "eligible": true,
    "compensation_amount": 600,
    "currency": "EUR", 
    "confidence": 95,
    "regulation": "EU261",
    "instant_payout_eligible": true,
    "reasoning": "Long-haul flight delayed >3 hours due to airline technical issue"
}

Model Information
Architecture

Base Model: Microsoft DialoGPT-medium
Training Method: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning
Training Data: 100+ expert-annotated legal scenarios
Performance: 85%+ accuracy on validation set

Supported Scenarios

Flight delays (2+ hours)
Flight cancellations
Denied boarding / overbooking
Baggage delays and loss
Technical vs weather delays
Strike classifications
Connecting flight disruptions
Cross-jurisdiction cases

Training Data
The model was trained on 100+ carefully crafted examples covering:
RegulationTraining ExamplesCoverageEU26150+ casesAll distance categories, extraordinary circumstancesUS DOT20+ casesDenied boarding, refunds, new 2024 rulesCanadian APPR15+ casesLarge/small carriers, control categoriesEdge Cases15+ casesComplex scenarios, low-confidence situations
Data Quality Standards

Expert-annotated legal analysis for each scenario
Real airline examples with actual flight numbers
Balanced dataset (60% eligible, 40% not eligible)
Edge case coverage for robust decision-making
Confidence calibration for business risk management

Business Applications
GYRO Integration
Designed specifically for integration with GYRO's boarding pass processing pipeline:

Jay (OCR) extracts flight details from boarding passes
Gyroscope04 analyzes compensation eligibility
Zara (Processing) handles payouts and claims

Instant Payout Logic

High confidence cases (80%+): Offer 60% instant payout
Medium confidence cases (70-79%): Standard processing
Low confidence cases (<70%): Human review required

Revenue Model

$19 processing fee per successful claim
Instant payout option increases conversion rates
Reduced legal costs through automation
