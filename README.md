# Gyroscope04 - AI Legal Engine for Flight Compensation

**Instant flight compensation analysis powered by artificial intelligence**

Gyroscope04 is an AI engine that reads flight compensation laws (EU261, DOT, APPR, Montreal Convention) and instantly determines if passengers deserve compensation. What traditionally takes 8+ months of legal processing now happens in 30 seconds.

## Project Overview

### What It Does
- Analyzes flight disruptions against 4 major compensation regulations
- Determines eligibility for passenger compensation instantly  
- Calculates compensation amounts (€250-€600, $400-$1400, CAD $125-$1000)
- Provides confidence scores for business decision-making
- Identifies edge cases requiring human review

### Legal Coverage
- **EU261** - European Union flight compensation regulation
- **US DOT** - Department of Transportation passenger rights  
- **Canadian APPR** - Air Passenger Protection Regulations
- **Montreal Convention** - International baggage and injury claims

## Quick Start

### For Business Integration
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the enhanced V2 model
model_name = "eitanno/gyroscope04-legal-engine-enhanced"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Analyze a flight disruption
prompt = "Human: Lufthansa LH441 from Frankfurt to New York delayed 4 hours due to technical problem on March 15, 2024. Passenger seeks compensation.\\n\\nAssistant:"

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=150, temperature=0.1, do_sample=True)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
answer = response.split("Assistant:")[-1].strip()
print(answer)
```

### Example Output
```json
{
    "eligible": true,
    "compensation_amount": 600,
    "currency": "EUR", 
    "confidence": 95,
    "regulation": "EU261",
    "instant_payout_eligible": true,
    "reasoning": "Long-haul flight delayed >3 hours due to airline technical issue"
}
```

## Model Information

### Current Models
- **V1 (Original):** `eitanno/gyroscope04-legal-engine`
- **V2 (Enhanced):** `eitanno/gyroscope04-legal-engine-enhanced` ✅

### Architecture
- **Base Model:** Microsoft DialoGPT-medium (359M parameters)
- **Training Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning
- **Enhanced Training Data:** 305 unique regulatory Q&A pairs
- **Performance:** 90%+ accuracy on validation set
- **Training Platform:** Google Cloud Platform Tesla T4 GPU
- **Training Time:** 1 minute 50 seconds (highly optimized)

### Supported Scenarios
- Flight delays (2+ hours)
- Flight cancellations
- Denied boarding / overbooking
- Baggage delays and loss
- Technical vs weather delays
- Strike classifications
- Connecting flight disruptions
- Cross-jurisdiction cases

## Training Data

The V2 model was trained on 305 unique regulatory scenarios:

| Regulation | Training Examples | Coverage |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| EU261 | 120+ cases | All distance categories, extraordinary circumstances, edge cases |
| US DOT | 80+ cases | Denied boarding, refunds, tarmac delays, 2024 updates |
| Canadian APPR | 60+ cases | Large/small carriers, control categories, recent changes |
| Montreal Convention | 40+ cases | Baggage liability, international claims |
| Edge Cases | Cross-regulation | Complex scenarios, low-confidence situations |

### Data Quality Standards
- ✅ **No duplicates:** Every training example is unique
- ✅ **Expert-annotated:** Legal analysis for each scenario  
- ✅ **Real examples:** Actual airline cases with flight numbers
- ✅ **Balanced dataset:** Comprehensive coverage of eligible/ineligible cases
- ✅ **Edge case coverage:** Robust decision-making capabilities
- ✅ **Confidence calibration:** Business risk management integration

## Business Applications

### GYRO Integration
Designed specifically for integration with GYRO's boarding pass processing pipeline:

1. **Jay (OCR)** extracts flight details from boarding passes
2. **Gyroscope04** analyzes compensation eligibility
3. **Zara (Processing)** handles payouts and claims

### Instant Payout Logic
- **High confidence cases (80%+):** Offer 60% instant payout
- **Medium confidence cases (70-79%):** Standard processing
- **Low confidence cases (<70%):** Human review required

### Revenue Model
- $19 processing fee per successful claim
- Instant payout option increases conversion rates
- Reduced legal costs through automation
